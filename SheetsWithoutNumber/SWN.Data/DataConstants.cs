You can draw or produce this object as an On Turn action, and your point-blank ranged attacks made from surprise with it cannot miss the target.\nLevel 2: You can take a Move action on the same round as you make an Execution Attack, closing rapidly with a target before you attack.

You can call on one favor per game day and the GM decides how far they’ll go for you.\nLevel 2: Once per game session, if it’s not entirely implausible, you meet someone you know who is willing to do modest favors for you.

A henchman obtained with this focus will serve in loyal fashion until clearly betrayed or placed in unacceptable danger. Henchmen are not “important” people in their society, and are usually marginal sorts, outcasts, the desperate, or other persons with few options. You can use more conventional pay or inducements to acquire additional henchmen, but these extra hirelings are no more loyal or competent than your pay and treatment can purchase.\nLevel 1: Gain Lead as a bonus skill. You can acquire henchmen within 24 hours of arriving in a community, assuming anyone is suitable hench material. These henchmen will not fight except to save their own lives, but will escort you on adventures and risk great danger to help you. Most henchmen will be treated as Peaceful Humans from the Xenobestiary section of the book. You can have one henchmen at a time for every three character levels you have, rounded up. You can release henchmen with no hard feelings at any plausible time and pick them back up later should you be without a current henchman.\nLevel 2: Your henchmen are remarkably loyal and determined, and will fight for you against anything but clearly overwhelming odds. Whether through natural competence or their devotion to you, they’re treated as Martial Humans from the Xenobestiary section. You can make faithful henchmen out of skilled and highly-capable NPCs, but this requires that you actually have done them some favor or help that would reasonably earn such fierce loyalty.";

Your maximum Effort increases by one.\nLevel 2: When you advance a level, the bonus psychic skill you chose for the first level of the focus automatically gets one skill point put toward increasing it or purchasing a technique from it.

It’s up to the GM to decide what’s reasonable and fair to be covered under this gift.If an ability is particularly powerful, it might require the user to take System Strain to use it, as described on page 32.
